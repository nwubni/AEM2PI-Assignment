Employee Onboarding & Account Setup
Q: How do I access my employee portal for the first time?
A: New employees receive a welcome email with login credentials and a link to the employee portal. If you haven't received this email, contact HR at hr@company.com or call extension 1234. You'll need to set up two-factor authentication on your first login.

Q: What information do I need to complete during onboarding?
A: During onboarding, you'll need to provide: personal information (address, emergency contacts), tax forms (W-4), direct deposit information, benefits selections, and signed acknowledgment of company policies. All forms must be completed within your first week of employment.

Q: How do I update my personal information after onboarding?
A: Log into the employee portal, navigate to "My Profile" > "Personal Information," make your changes, and click "Save." Changes to address, phone number, or emergency contacts take effect immediately. Changes to name or tax information require HR approval and may take 2-3 business days.

Q: I forgot my password. How do I reset it?
A: Click "Forgot Password?" on the login page and enter your work email address. You'll receive a password reset link within 5 minutes. If you don't receive the email, check your spam folder or contact IT support at it-support@company.com.
