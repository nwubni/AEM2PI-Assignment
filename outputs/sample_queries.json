      "Q: How do I check my current PTO balance?\nA: Log into the employee portal and navigate to \"Time Off\" > \"My Balance.\" You'll see your accrued PTO, used PTO, pending requests, and available balance. The balance updates in real-time as requests are approved.\n\nQ: What is the company's policy on unpaid leave?\nA: Unpaid leave may be granted for extended personal circumstances, medical emergencies, or family care situations. Requests must be submitted at least 30 days in advance (except emergencies) and require approval from both your manager and HR. Unpaid leave is limited to 12 weeks per calendar year.\n\nBenefits & Enrollment\nQ: When can I enroll in or change my benefits?\nA: New employees can enroll during their first 30 days of employment. Existing employees can make changes during the annual open enrollment period (typically November 1-15) or within 30 days of a qualifying life event (marriage, birth, job loss of spouse, etc.).\nSource: data/faq_document.txt",
      "Q: How much paid time off (PTO) do I accrue?\nA: Full-time employees accrue PTO at the following rates: 0-2 years: 15 days/year, 3-5 years: 20 days/year, 6+ years: 25 days/year.

Part-time employees accrue PTO on a pro-rated basis.\n\nQ: Can I carry over unused PTO to the next year?\nA: You can carry over up to 5 days of unused PTO to the next calendar year. Any PTO in excess of 5 days will be forfeited if not used by December 31st. Carry-over requests must be submitted by November 15th.\n\nQ: What is the difference between sick leave and personal time?\nA: Sick leave is for illness, medical appointments, or caring for a sick family member. Personal time is for non-medical personal matters. Both count toward your PTO balance, but sick leave may be used without prior approval in emergency situations. Personal time requires manager approval in advance.\nSource: data/faq_document.txt",

Break times should be recorded in your timesheet.\n\nQ: How do I report overtime?\nA: Overtime (hours worked over 40 per week) must be pre-approved by your manager. Log your overtime hours in your timesheet and ensure your manager has approved the overtime request. Overtime is paid at 1.5x your regular hourly rate.\n\nCompany Policies & Procedures\nQ: What is the company's remote work policy?\nA: Employees in eligible roles may work remotely up to 3 days per week with manager approval.
